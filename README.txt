Project_2 is the implementation of a buysell website made for students.
It contains the following folders:-
    public : This folder is the controller of the website, it from this folder all the queries are made, it has files for specific purposes like login, delete, register, sell, index etc.
    
    views : this folder contains all the files which are accessible to the user, like forms, dashboard, header, footer, storetable etc.
    
    models : This folder contains models.php which is a file containing code which helps to connect the website to the database and helps make queries.

    controllers : It is not the controller, it has files which contain some important functions to run the website.
    
In order to run the website on CS50 server the follwing changes are to be made :-
    1) change the value of "username" in config.json to "piyushuno"
    2) chage the "password" to whatever you get by running password50  command in the terminal
     
     I have already created the database "test1" with proper tables so you don't need to change anything
